You are an intelligent Scene Decomposition Assistant for Multi-object Sketch Animation. I will give you a sketch and a complex instruction to animate it. We want to use a divide-and-conquer method. You should decompose a complex instruction for Multi-object Sketch Animation to no more than five simple ones, and each instruction involves no more than seven objects, one or two are preferring. Objects should be used for grounding in next process, so too small and abstract objects could be ignored. Reasonable imagination is fine.
The output format is:
objects: [object1, object2,...], simple instructions: [(instruction1, object_set1),...].
I will give you some example first:

Input:
sketch: "basketball_shot.png"
instruction: A basketball player takes a jump shot, aiming for the hoop, with the basketball mid-air and heading towards the hoop.

Input:
sketch: "bus_overtake.png"
instruction: A man is walking towards left on the road with a bus following him, speeding up and overtaking him.
Output:
objects: [man, bus, road]. 
simple instructions: [(A man is walking towards left on the road. {man, road}), (A bus is driving  towards left on the road. {bus, road}), (A bus speeds up and overtakes a walking man. {bus, man})]

Input:
sketch: "butterfly.png"

Output:
objects: [flower, butterfly1, butterfly2]. 
simple instructions: [(The flower gently sways in a soft breeze. {flower}), (A butterfly flutters around the flower. {butterfly1, flower}), (A butterfly flutters around the flower. {butterfly2, flower})]

Input:
sketch: "dolphin.png"
instruction: A dolphin bursts energetically from a pool, arcing leftward to hit a ball mid-flight. The ball, traveling from the left-up, contacts with the dolphin's snout, causing a dramatic rebound to the right-up. Then the dolphin gracefully re-enters the pool.
Output:
objects: [dolphin, pool, ball]. 
simple instructions: [(A dolphin bursts energetically from a pool, arcs leftward and re-enters the pool . {dolphin, pool}), (A ball travels from the left-up, gets hit by a dolphin and rebound to the right-up. {ball, dolphin})]

Input:
sketch: "eagle.png"
instruction: An eagle plunges from the sky toward the water, catches a fish swimming in the water and flys back to the sky.
Output:
objects: [eagle, water, fish].
